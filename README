git-svn-diff

Git command for creating SVN patches from Git.

Install:

	go get -u github.com/eaigner/git-svn-diff

Usage:

If you have $GOPATH/bin on your $PATH you can now invoke the command with

	git svn-diff <commitish> [ <svn-commitish> ]

The first argument tells svn-diff which local commit do generate the diff against. The second argument is optional and tells svn-diff from which commit to derive the SVN revision. If omitted, will be the same as the first argument.
